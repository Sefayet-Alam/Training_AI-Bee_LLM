To move the player character using Godot's GDScript and the keyboard, you must use input events and update the player's location accordingly. Here's a simple example of how you can do it:

1. Create a new scene and add KinematicBody2D as the player character. This will be node you want to move.
2.Attach a script to the node Player.gd.
3.Open the script and implement the following code:

<code_start>

extends KinematicBody2D

export var speed = 200  # Adjust this value to control the player's movement speed.

func _physics_process(delta):
    # Input handling for movement
    var direction = Vector2.ZERO

    if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_right"):
        direction.x += 1
    if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_left"):
        direction.x -= 1
    if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_down"):
        direction.y += 1
    if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_up"):
        direction.y -= 1
    
    direction = direction.normalized() #To normalize the direction vector 
    var velocity = direction * speed
    move_and_collide(velocity * delta)


<code_end>

When you launch the game and use the arrow keys, the player character should now travel in the chosen direction at the set pace.

Again, make sure the collision forms for the player character are properly configured to handle collisions with the environment and other objects in your game world.


Due to the explicit requirement for GDScript code that permits player movement using the keyboard in Godot, I classified it as a "Programming" work in answer to the original query. The emphasis on implementing a function within the context of game development naturally falls under the area of programming. I offered a step-by-step explanation of the method to construct the response, guiding the development of a new scene with a player character node, script attachment, and implementation of keyboard input processing in GDScript. However, in the first code, I unintentionally used move_and_collide on the erroneous Node2D instead of a KinematicBody2D. Recognising this issue, I rewrote the code to assure its correctness and efficacy, allowing the player character to roam freely in the environment.

Throughout the response, I attempted to explain the code's reasoning as simply as possible, appealing to folks who are comfortable with fundamental programming but may be unfamiliar with Godot and GDScript. To overcome challenges, I concentrated on correctly comprehending the question, checking the code, and offering a thorough explanation. In times of doubt, I recognised the significance of eliciting more information from the user in order to provide a personalised and exact response.
