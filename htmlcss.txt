Given prompt is unclear and hard to follow . Please give proper instructions and details of the code or the project you want to complete. Considering the given prompt and intuition it seems that you to wish to use the pymavlink library to deliver a status text message. However, there appears to be a gap in the code since the "master" object is not specified. To send a status text message using pymavlink, you must first connect to an MAVLink-enabled device or system.

Assuming you've successfully connected to the MAVLink system, here's how to send a status text message with pymavlink:

<code_start>
```python 

from pymavlink import mavutil

# Replace 'your_serial_port' with the actual serial port your MAVLink device is connected to (e.g., '/dev/ttyUSB0', 'COM3')
# Replace 'your_baud_rate' with the baud rate of your MAVLink device (e.g., 57600, 115200)
# If you are connecting over UDP, replace 'your_ip_address' and 'your_udp_port' with the appropriate values.
master = mavutil.mavlink_connection('your_serial_port', baud=your_baud_rate)

# Define your status text message parameters
severity = mavutil.mavlink.MAV_SEVERITY_INFO  # Set the severity of the message (e.g., INFO)
text = "Your status message goes here"  # Replace this with the desired status text

# Send the status text message
master.mav.statustext_send(severity, text)

```
<code_end>

Replace 'your_serial_port,' 'your_baud_rate,' and the text variable with the values suitable for your MAVLink connection configuration and the content of your status text message.

Please  ensure that you have installed the pymavlink library before running the code. You can install it using pip using the following code:

<code_start>
```python 


pip install pymavlink

```
<code_end>
